        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>
            <ol>Earlier this year i took a Databases course and we worked on individual projets as a class. My project personally was on an online cab business, this Online Cab Booking project deals with an online system designed for booking cabs as per the requirements of the customers at their convenience. The current system is manual, and it is time-consuming. It is also cost-ineffective, and the average return is low and diminishing.  
            The goal is to give customer satisfaction the utmost priority and so give ample options to book cab by entering details like their journey date and time, pick-up point, destination and the drop-off point they need to reach. The system is made to realize if it is a new customer or registered customer in order to either sign up or log in, Search for available cabs, manage bookings and payment authorization. 
            It moves from the User or Personnel booking his Cab with the following included in the database:</ol> 
            <ul>•	Customer details
            •	Cab Availability
            •	Pick up point/time
            •	Final destination</ul>
            <ol>The proposed Online Cab Booking project system ensures that the users can book the cab as per their requirements by logging on to the website. It allows users to book their cabs online, manage their bookings and cancel their bookings at any point of time.
            The users will get notified about the driver and his mobile no. so as to communicate with him. Regular updates are provided to the customer so that they are aware of their bookings, driver details, and booking status.</ol>
            The advantages include; 
            <ol>It enhances business processes since it makes use of internet technology to increase their profits. </ol>
            <ol>The software acts as a 24/7 office due to its all-time availability.</ol>
            <ol>It increases the efficiency of the system in offering quality services to its customers.It’s user-friendly as they can book cabs from the comfort of their homes or offices.</ol>
            <ol>It’s highly secure as it requires only a logged in person to book the cab which prevents misuse of their details by intruders.</ol>
